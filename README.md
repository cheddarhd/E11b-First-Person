# E11b-First-Person

Very cool assignemnt am facing aN indent error that is not allowing it to run but this excercise shows us how we basic fps games are created. It thought switching to the double view made it much easier to postions the shot gun into the frame of the camera. I had a little trouble navigating in the 3D space as I felt I couldn't get the right angle to change things around. Overall helpful assignment.
